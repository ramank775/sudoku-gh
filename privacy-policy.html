    <p>Raman built the Sudoku app as a free app. This service is provided by Raman at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

    <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information if anyone decided to use my service.</p>

    <p>If you choose to use my service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The personal information that I collect is used for providing and improving the service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

    <p>The app is designed with privacy as a core principle. Most of your personal data remains on your device and is not transmitted to external servers.</p>

    <h3>Local Data Storage</h3>
    <p>The following information is stored locally on your device and is not collected by us:</p>

        <li>Completed puzzles and achievements</li>
        <li>Daily challenge streaks and history</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Analytics Data Collection (New in v1.11.0)</h3>
    <p>Starting with version 1.11.0, we collect limited, privacy-focused analytics through our self-hosted Plausible Analytics server (analytics.one9x.com) to improve the app experience:</p>

    </ul>

    </ul>

        <li><strong>Plausible Analytics</strong> (self-hosted at analytics.one9x.com) - for privacy-focused usage analytics</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Shop Section and External Retailer Links</h3>
    <p>Our app includes a shop section that displays Sudoku-related products (books, puzzles, etc.) and provides links to purchase these items from various online retailers. These links are provided dynamically at runtime and may direct you to external websites including, but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Amazon</strong> and its regional domains</li>
        <li><strong>Flipkart</strong> and other e-commerce platforms</li>
        <li><strong>Other online bookstores and retailers</strong></li>
    </ul>

We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any external websites you visit through our app.</p>

    <p>We do not track which external links you click or receive any personal information from these third-party retailers unless you voluntarily provide it to them directly.</p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>

    <p>This service does not use these "cookies" explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use "cookies" to collect information and improve their services.

        <li>To perform service-related services; or</li>

    </ul>

    <p>I want to inform users of this service that these third parties have access to your personal information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>

    <p>I value your trust in providing us your personal information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>These services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.</p>
